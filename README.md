# Crime Scene Investigation ("CSI" or "CSI")

## Mission Statement

 * To uphold the EOS Constitution
 * To serve and protect the EOS Community and its Members
 
## Executive Summary

The CSI's purpose is to aid enforcement of the Constitution.

The CSI does not hold any official authority to enforce; it rather aids in enforcement efforts by collecting evidence for cases to aid in the adjudication due-process.

This is done by collaborating and coordinating with the official bodies: Block Producers and Arbitrators.
